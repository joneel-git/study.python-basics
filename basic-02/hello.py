# Example if else vs Ternary operator 
# wheather = "It's Raining"

# if wheather == "sunny":
#     print("Let's go outside") # True
# else:
#     print('Not today!.. ') # False

# Ternary operator
# Works little different than other languages we begin by writing the true statemnt first what we want.
wheather = "sunny"
print("Let's go outside!.") if wheather == "sunny" else print("Not Today...!") # Output True it's sunny.
    #   True                                         #   False
